"""
Recursion is an approach to problem  solving where the solution depends partially on solutions to smaller instances of
related problems like in searching, enumeration, divide-and-conquer, and decomposing a complex problem into a set of
similar instances are all scenarios where recursion may be suitable.
Divide and Conquer is NOT synonymous with recursion. Recursion is more general. Sometimes divide and conquer algorithm
implemented using iteration instead of recursion to improve runtime adn space complexity.
