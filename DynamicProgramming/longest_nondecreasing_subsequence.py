"""
Write a program that takes as input an array of numbers and returns the length of a longest nondecreasing
subsequence in the array.
Example: arr = [0, 8, 4, 12, 2, 10, 6, 14, 1, 9]
Longest: [0, 4, 10, 14] or [0, 2, 6, 9]

Hint: Express the longest nondecreasing subsequence ending at entry in terms of the longest nondecreasing
subsequence appearing in the subarray consisting of preceding elements.
